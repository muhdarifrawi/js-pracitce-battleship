# js-pracitce-battleship
My attempt in creating a classic battleship game solely on "vanilla javascript first" method. 

## Preface
Welcome to my GitPage. First of all I would like to thank you for dropping by. This project was created as a practice and challenge for me.
This challenge scenario was given to me by my friend Arwa whom she herself was working on it as well. 

If you come across this page and find it useful, do let me know. If you wish to use pieces of my code (which I highly doubt anyone would 
want to) or was inspired by it, do put up an acknowlegment and a link back to this page of mine. It would help me greatly in my personal 
questline. 

Thank you once again. Have a good day ahead! 

P.S: I know I misspelled practice. This is why you need to proofread before publishing. Hahaha.

## Introduction
This is a one-page webpage application focused on using Vanilla JavaScript. No extension nor frameworks were to be used during the 
development side of the JavaScript. As much as possible, I am trying to put in necessary comments within my code. Also, during this 
practice, I am trying to learn into putting better commit messages and better documentation about my project.
